# Customizable Support Chatbot with Sentiment Analysis

This project is a smart e-commerce support chatbot built with **Next.js**, **Google Gemini API**, and **ShadCN UI components**. The chatbot provides real-time assistance to users, analyzes their sentiments, and stores all conversation data in the browser's `localStorage`. It also collects user feedback and saves it for future insights. For now I have taken a usecase as if it is a support assistant for an e-commerce store of shoes named [Snikre](https://www.snikre.com)(which is my brand itself).

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chatbot**: Uses AI and ML algorithms to provide intelligent responses.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of user messages (positive, neutral, or negative).
- **Local Data Storage**: Stores conversation history and sentiment data in `localStorage` for persistence.
- **Feedback Collection**: Collects user feedback on products for sentiment tracking and insights.
- **Modern UI**: Built with ShadCN's elegant and responsive UI components.
- **Lightweight and Fast**: Optimized for performance and usability.

## How It Works

1. **User Interaction**: Users type messages in the chatbot interface.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Each user message is analyzed for sentiment using a lightweight sentiment analysis function.
3. **Response Generation**: The Google Gemini API generates intelligent responses based on the conversation context.
4. **Data Persistence**: 
   - The entire conversation, including sentiment data, is saved in the browser's `localStorage`.
   - Feedback for specific products is collected and also stored in `localStorage`.
